# [Wireless Kinesis Advantage BLE](https://github.com/mikewudev/KinesisBLE)

Turns the Kinesis Advantage Keyboard keyboard into a wireless BLE keyboard with a few extra features. Built with Adafruit's nRF52 Feather Express Arduino boards.

For instructions, see the **[wiki](https://github.com/sysdevmike/KinesisBLE/wiki)**. For more details on the build check out the **[project](https://hackaday.io/project/161578-wireless-ble-kinesis-advantage-custom-controller)**.

This firmware was used with the hardware fork from:
https://github.com/ergodone/KinesisBLE
It should work with all the KinesisBLE v5 boards and boards with same gpio connections.

To enter bootloader:
Press reset button twice or once ZMK is loaded the default keymap combo <= program> goes to the bootloader.  The keyboard will show up as "FTHR840BOOT" drive.

To build firmware:
Build Zephyr blinky example.  That ensures the environment and tools are all present.  If you have a J-Link you can run the example but it will overwrite the existing bootloader. For ZMK it is recommended to use the Adafruit bootloader and upload uf2 files.

rom app directory do:
 west build -p -b adafruit_feather_nrf52840 -- -DSHIELD=kinesisble


To restore original Adafruit firmware download from:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases
then install with Jlink with following command:
nrfjprog --program feather_nrf52840_express_bootloader-0.4.1_s140_6.1.1.hex --chiperase -f nrf52 --reset
